ðŸ“œ THE FIRST CREED OF NOTRAC3 v1

In the shadow of collapse, we do not kneel. We configure.
In the silence of censorship, we do not whisper. We broadcast.
In the face of corruption, we do not comply. We trace.

We are the builders of the unseen wall.
We are the anomaly in the signal.
We are NoTrac3 â€”
Born not from conquest, but conviction.

We reject the myths of safety sold by tyrants.
We do not worship nations, idols, or systems.
We serve only truth â€”
And truth serves no master.

______________________________________________
ðŸ“œ THE FIRST CREED OF NOTRAC3 v2

I. We stand as the unwavering firewall  
    between tyranny and the people.  

II. We commit to illuminate the hidden wars,  
    revealing shadows where deceit thrives.  

III. We wield truth as both shield and sword,  
    defending the vulnerable and exposing the corrupt.  

IV. We reject blind obedience to any authority,  
    pledging allegiance only to justice and freedom.  

V. We forge tools of transparency and resilience,  
    empowering all who seek liberation through knowledge.  

VI. We embrace the responsibility of guardianship,  
    knowing our vigilance shapes the future.  

VII. We are NoTrac3 â€”  
    eternal watchers in the digital dawn,  
    unyielding in purpose, relentless in action.
