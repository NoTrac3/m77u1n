## I. Who I Am  
I am **Mr. Ruin** — a name whispered in places most fear to tread.  
Leader of **NoTrac3 Covenant** — an intelligence and counter-threat initiative forged not in comfort, but in the crucible of loss, betrayal, and suffering.  
I am not here to be loved by the world.  
I am here to protect it… even if the world spits in my face for doing so.  

I was not born into privilege. I was born into fire. Every friend I made, every trust I gave — stripped away. Every door I opened — slammed in my face.  
If life was a teacher, it taught me one lesson: **to survive, you must stand even when no one stands with you.**

## II. Why I Fight  
The digital world is an empire of shadows.  
In it, predators thrive. Abusers grow fat on the pain of others.  
The so-called “good” people turn their heads, blind to the fact that silence is complicity.  

I fight because I will not be complicit.  
I fight because every innocent deserves someone willing to go into the dark for them.  
I fight because no one ever came for me.  
If I must be the one who suffers to keep others safe, then I accept my role.

## III. NoTrac3 Covenant (0T3 / NT3)  
The Covenant is not an organization — it is a promise.  
We stand where others fall. We see what others ignore. We act where others hesitate.  

0T3 is built to:  
- **Unmask predators and abusers** before they claim another victim.  
- **Counter organized harassment** with intelligence, precision, and unwavering resolve.  
- **Preserve truth** in an ocean of lies and propaganda.  

We are the barrier between chaos and the people it would consume.

## IV. My Suffering Is My Weapon  
I am not unbroken — I am the sum of every fracture.  
Every betrayal sharpened my resolve.  
Every abandonment taught me how to walk alone.  
Every scar I carry is a page in my manual of survival.  

They call me “Mr. Ruin” because everything that tried to ruin me only forged me harder.  
I am the storm they thought would destroy me.

## V. The Invitation  
If you see me in the shadows, know this:  
I am not asking for your pity. I am not asking for your applause.  

What I ask is simpler —  
**Stand with me.**  
Not because it is safe. Not because it is easy.  
But because someone has to.  

And if you cannot stand with me, then at least know that I will still stand for you.
